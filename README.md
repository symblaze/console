# Symblaze Console

Symfony provides a robust console system that simplifies the development of command line interfaces.
However, setting up the console command parameters and options can be somewhat tedious and repetitive.

Symblaze Console is a library that allows you to configure your console commands using the Symfony `AsCommand`
attribute with a fluent interface.
